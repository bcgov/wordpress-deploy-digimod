- where does the image on artifactory fit in? Bitnami wordpress?
- Multisite configuration?
- how to update wordpress?

Problematic commit - https://github.com/bcgov/wordpress/commit/2a48dab7f7b9a14a1e89847695340fb0c21fc4f2

configs were moved into docker builds, but not cahnged in deploy configs. Ex. deploy-nginx-wordpress.yaml


-project namespace is hardcoded

- maria db deployment replica set hits limits, change from:
- resources:
limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 500Mi
requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 100Mi

limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 500Mi
requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 100Mi


- changed artifactory address:
from docker-remote.artifacts.developer.gov.bc.ca/alpine:3.15.4
to artifacts.developer.gov.bc.ca/docker-remote/alpine:3.15.4
(old url certificate has wrong date)

Need to start builds manually to populate imagestreams

remember to rename images to test
oc -n c0cce6-tools tag wordpress-mariadb-run:dev wordpress-mariadb-run:test

oc -n c0cce6-tools tag wordpress-nginx-run:dev wordpress-nginx-run:test

oc -n c0cce6-tools tag wordpress-wordpress-run:dev wordpress-wordpress-run:test

oc -n c0cce6-tools tag wordpress-sidecar-run:dev wordpress-sidecar-run:test

sidecar requests 6gb, hits the quota, reduced to 3

for prod:
oc -n c0cce6-tools tag wordpress-mariadb-run:dev wordpress-mariadb-run:prod
